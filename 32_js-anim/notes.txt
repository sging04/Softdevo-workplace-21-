why y > c.height - dvdHeight?
		
because of the fact tha things are not place at center and
are compared to the disctance of the top left most corner, we
do - dvdHeight or - dvdWidth to reaccount for it, so it changes direction
when the lower right corner collides instead....


remember to change the callback
