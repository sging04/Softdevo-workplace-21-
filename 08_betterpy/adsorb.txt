Questions:
- How would our programs' running time scale in comparison with larger CSV files?
- Are they any inefficiancies that can be fixed simply?
- Can a freshie understand this?
- Will the different methods of solving the same problem sometimes have advantages under different scenarios?
- Are there any other data structures that could help solve this problem?

Comments:
- One of our teammates' codes uses a second dictionary in order to store consecutive sums
- One of out teammates had their weighted occupation selector return unemployed for with a percentage of 100 - the total percentages of the occupations
- Most of our teamates used a consecutive sum to solve the problem, but one instead produced a random percentage as a float and then used consecutive subtraction from that float, returing the final occupation that tipped this new value either to zero or below it

Concerns:
- Although the comments were helpful, they were not enough to prevent our group from having to ask each other clarification questions
- The naming conventions implemented in our code could likely be improved
- It was often difficult to find the appropriate repository due to the names that people chose
- The repositories that were linked under stuy-softdev/workshop21-22/1 were not updated
- People had different names for their files containing python
