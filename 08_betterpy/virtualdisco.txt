K08 -- Visiting Workshops and Investigating a Command
2021-09-30

Investigate the Command: $ python3 -m venv ~/myherozero

1. Running the command on my personal computer led to the creation of a directory myherozero that was a subdirectory of the directory ~, which in and of itself was a subdirectory of the directory in which I excecuted the command
2. The myherozero directory included a file called pyvenv.cfg and its contents appeared as such:
09/30/2021  08:31 PM    <DIR>          .
09/30/2021  08:31 PM    <DIR>          ..
09/30/2021  08:31 PM    <DIR>          Include
09/30/2021  08:31 PM    <DIR>          Lib
09/30/2021  08:31 PM               164 pyvenv.cfg
09/30/2021  08:31 PM    <DIR>          Scripts
               1 File(s)            164 bytes
               5 Dir(s)  458,167,877,632 bytes free
3. The python3 command opens a python interactive sesssion specifically of python3
4. -m allows a module =located on the Python module path to be executed as a script
5. The venv is short for 'virtual environment' and indicates a module
6. ~/myherozero indicates the path to that target location
7. ~/ is shorthand for the current user's home folder
8. The entire command creates a lightweight "virtual environment" at the target location - this should be a directory called myherozero that is a subdirectory of the user's home/root folder, but on my machine (I ran the command through the command prompt on Windows 10) the command had a slightly different result
