K14 - Form and Function/Intro to Flask/App to echo input from user. 
Oct 14 2021 

Notable: 
- When one line is commented out at a time from login.html, the website still successfully loads and takes input. When corressponding sets of code are commented out, an error message pops up citing no username field found. 
- 'GET' vs 'POST' method depends on how data is received and processed, whether it is simply accessing it or storing it through a remote server respectively. 
- Request obj and request args give helpful information to check if the program is receiving anything from the input and makes it easier to manipulate the data. 
- Adding new line print statements make it easier to see everything from a debugging standpoint. 
- render_template('response.html') acts upon response.html which connects the py file to the html file
- request.<something> acts upon "request"
- print(app) and print(request) shows that the program is running in the terminal. 

Questions:
- Is it more efficient to produce this webpage by template - returning the input as a variable and sending it to the html file, or simply printing the html through a return function?
