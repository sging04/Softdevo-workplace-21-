K15 - Sessions Greetings/Cookies & Error Handling/App to hadnle bad inputs and tracking username
Oct 19 2021 

Notable: 
- As usernames are submitted on the app.py side, the Firefox web devlopment tool tracks what kind of request was generated. 
- Redirection seems to be necessary for keeping cookies/session logged in 
- Unscriptable methods refer to the use of [] rather than () because of the syntax of how methods are called. 
- Using links to travel in between pages using <a href></a> seems to be the simplest way of logging out and trying account combinations
- Redirect still allows the login.html code to be called for a successful login just at a different url. 

Questions:
- Does it track lower vs upper case? We predict yes because when testing with lowercase password, log in fails.
