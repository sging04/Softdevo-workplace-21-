#Q0: What happens if you remove render_template from this line?

If we remove render_template, we are no longer able to call render_template on line 19 without throwing an error.

#Q1: Can all of your teammates confidently predict the URL to use to load this page?

We can. We think that localhost:5000/my_foist_template will be the URL to load this page.

#Q2: What is the significance of each argument?

The first argument passed in render_template specifies the file in the 'templates' folder to use as a template.
render_template collects the keyword specified arguments, 'foo' and 'collection' and looks at 'model_tmplt.html's syntax to determine what in it to replace.
In this specific case, model_tmplt has a loop that loops through collection and returns strings seperated by line breaks. 
It also has '{{foo}}', syntax to replace this with the value of foo we passed in the function.
