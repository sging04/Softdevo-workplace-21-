JSON: readable, friendly, reliable. But text-based, space consuming, limited
BSON (binary JSON): high performance, string, bool, numbers, arrays. Machine only. Used by Mongo DB.

MongoDB stores data in BSON, and you can then view it in JSON.

BSON is faster to parse and lighter to store than JSON.

JSON supports fewer data types than BSON.

Export in BSON. JSON better for human-viewing.
mongoimport
mongoexport
mongodump --uri: BSON
mongoexport --uri,--collection, --out -> JSON 
--uri, uniform resource identifier, srv: secure connection 
use drop, also used in mongo restore
