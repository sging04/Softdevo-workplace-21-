K13: Template for Success/ render_templates, randomly generating, app.route
10-07-2021

One way to generate a Random occupation is to create a random number, then choose a percentage from the csv
and then see if that value is greater than the randomly selected value. 
The render_template acts upon an html file, and puts in different values of different "variables" in the html file.
For instance in render_template there is foo="Random Occupation" which will have the html file display the Radom Occupation.
Moreover, it acts upon chosen to equal a randomly generated occupation by using the code
chosen= generateRandom(readfile("data/occupations.csv". 


Ego
The programmer must have abilities and a willingness to work

If a programmer makes his program an extension of themselves,
they will be unwilling to critically examine their code objectively, as they value the current state of their code a reflection of them.
This stifles any opportunity for them to get better.
Successful programming groups allow other people to help discover the person's errors.
The people that will grow are those willing and accepting that they will be lacking in their code, but are willing to learn and bite the bullet.
There is a very likely chance that your code has errors, accept it and then look to find them
with others who look at your code more objectively than you.

This applies to many facets of life: those able to detach from their craft and accept criticism grow their skills faster
and are usually the top of their work.
